🛠️ Features

🎯 Visual Thread Management:

Real-time progress visualization
Color-coded thread states
Interactive synchronization control


🔄 Synchronization Points:

Multiple checkpoint barriers (25%, 50%, 75%)
Event-based thread coordination
Visual state indication


📊 Progress Monitoring:

Individual thread progress tracking
Color-coded state feedback
Dynamic speed simulation



📦 Dependencies

JEDI Visual Components (Required)

Used for enhanced progress bars
Components needed:

TJvXPProgressBar




Standard VCL Components

Built-in Delphi components
System thread support
Synchronization objects



🔧 Installation

📥 Install Dependencies:

Install JEDI Visual Components (JVCL)
Ensure VCL components are installed


🖥️ Project Setup:

Open the project in Delphi
Compile and run



⚙️ Usage

🚀 Start Simulation:

Click the Start button to begin thread execution
Watch as threads progress independently


🔄 Synchronization:

Use Sync button at checkpoints
Observe color changes indicating states:

Green: Active processing
Yellow: Waiting at checkpoint
Lime: Just synchronized




🛑 Stop Execution:

Click Stop to terminate all threads
Progress bars turn red to indicate stopped state
